# The ABC of macroeconomic agent-based modelling

A fast and easy to use Julia implementation of the model described in [_Emergent dynamics of a macroeconomic agent based model with capital and credit_](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165188914001572).
The package can be used to simulate the original model or as a base for extensions. If you are not familiar with Julia and the way in which multiple dispatch allows for powerful extensions, don't hesitate to get in touch!

## Installation

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("ABCredit")
```

## Quick example

```julia
using ABCredit

W = 1000 # number of workers
F = 100  # number of consumption firms
N = 20   # number of capital firms

model = ABCredit.initialise_model(W, F, N)

T = 1000 # number of epochs

d = ABCredit.run_one_sim!(model, T)
```

To plot the results of the simulation, install the `Plots` package via ```Pkg.add("Plots")```  and then run

```julia
using Plots

plot(d.Y_real)
```

## Citing _ABCredit_

If you found this package useful for your research, please cite (one of) the following publication(s): the research works that made it possible to develop and release _ABCredit.jl_.

In this work, we extend _ABCredit.jl_ with reinforcement learning agents:

  title={Simulating the economic impact of rationality through reinforcement learning and agent-based modelling},
  author={Brusatin, Simone and Padoan, Tommaso and Coletta, Andrea and Delli Gatti, Domenico and Glielmo, Aldo},
  booktitle={Proceedings of the 5th ACM International Conference on AI in Finance},
  pages={159--167},
  year={2024}
}
```

In this work, we calibrate _ABCredit.jl_ efficiently using reinforcement learning to select search methods (the calibration code is [here](https://github.com/bancaditalia/black-it/blob/main/examples/RL_to_combine_search_methods.ipynb)):
