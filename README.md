# ABCredit.jl

A fast and easy to use Julia implementation of the model described in [_Emergent dynamics of a macroeconomic agent based model with capital and credit_](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165188914001572).
The package can be used to simulate the original model or as a base for extensions. If you are not familiar with Julia and the way in which multiple dispatch allows for powerful extensions, don't hesitate to get in touch!

## Installation

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("ABCredit")
```

## Quick example

```julia
using ABCredit

W = 1000 # number of workers
F = 100  # number of consumption firms
N = 20   # number of capital firms

model = ABCredit.initialise_model(W, F, N)

T = 1000 # number of epochs

d = ABCredit.run_one_sim!(model, T)
```

To plot the results of the simulation, install the `Plots` package via ```Pkg.add("Plots")```  and then run

```julia
using Plots

plot(d.Y_real)
```
